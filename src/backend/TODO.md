* Use mock data to create a new UI that shows Damage Graph
* "Stacked Line Chart"
* Timeline Bars underneath for while Boss Abilities are active -- do same "offsetting" strategy from prior design, use minimal rows possible
* Timeline Bars underneath Boss Abilities - Player Abilities.
* Default zoom amount for now = show 2 minutes at a time on laptop screen?


* For now, just show "what happened"
* Re-do planning screen to let you drag these cooldown bars around, showing you anything that's invalid but not _stopping_ you from doing it
* Move Roster/overrides to bottom
* No more Boss timeline tab or constants, now we always use data from a prior fight!

* Final feature: What was planned VS what happened. See how far off the plan was in some kind of visual diff (one above the other).
